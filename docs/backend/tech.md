# Important Technologies:
* **Flask** | [Docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/): Python web framework similar to Django but with much less functionality built-in
* **SQLAlchemy** | [Docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/): Middleware, an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that allows us to handle database queries and data as Python objects instead of primitives (str, etc)
* **Pytest** | [Docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/contents.html): popular Python testing framework
* **Factory-boy** | [Docs](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): a library used to help take a lot of the mess and tedium out of setting up sample database contents for testing. Basically, it auto-generates our data with relationships included.
